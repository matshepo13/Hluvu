Victim (Matshepo): "Why are you doing this, Spha? Just let me go! Stop beating me—please!"

Suspect (Spha): "You thought you could betray me and no one would find out? That you'd get away with exposing those files?"

Victim (Matshepo): "I didn’t betray you! Maseko threatened me—he would’ve destroyed everything if I didn’t comply."

Suspect (Spha): "Maseko? You expect me to believe that? You ruined everything I built for years."

Victim (Matshepo): "I thought it would stop the corruption, not hurt you. I was trying to protect us both."

Suspect (Spha): "Protect? You left me to be the scapegoat while you played the hero."

Victim (Matshepo): "Please, Spha, we can still fix this. We need to take down Maseko together."

Suspect (Spha) (pauses, conflicted): "Maybe you’re right. But don’t think this erases your betrayal, Matshepo. You’ve already taken too much."
